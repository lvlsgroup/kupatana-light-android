  * Each category has it's own tab. Clicking on a tab switches to the category it represents.

  * Each list item should show the ad image (if available) and title.
2. Detail screen
  * The ad image (if available), title and description should be shown.
  * It should be possible to navigate back to the listing screen using both back and up navigation.
